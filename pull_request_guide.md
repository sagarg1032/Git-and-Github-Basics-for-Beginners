### Pull Request Guide

#### What is a Pull Request?
A pull request lets you inform others about changes you’ve pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. It enables collaborative review and integration of your changes into the main branch.

#### Steps to Create a Pull Request

1. **Push your changes to a branch:** Ensure that you’ve pushed your changes to a branch in your repository.

2. **Locate the "Compare & Pull Request" Button:**
   - On GitHub, navigate to your repository.
   - GitHub will show a "Compare & Pull Request" button. Click it to open the pull request window.

3. **Fill in Pull Request Details:**
   - Select the branches:
     - **Base:** The branch you want to merge changes into (e.g., `main`).
     - **Compare:** The branch containing your changes (e.g., `feature1`).
   - Provide a title and description for the pull request, such as:
     ```
     Add new feature: Improved UI for dashboard
     ```

4. **Create the Pull Request:**
   - Once all details are added, click the **Create Pull Request** button.

#### Review Process

1. **Automatic Merge Check:**
   - GitHub will analyze whether the changes can be merged automatically (e.g., if no conflicts exist).

2. **Review by Repository Maintainers:**
   - The author of the `main` branch or a senior developer will review the pull request.
   - They may leave comments or request changes for improvement.

3. **Merge the Pull Request:**
   - If the pull request is approved:
     - Click **Merge Pull Request**.
     - Confirm the merge by clicking **Confirm Merge**.
   - A new commit will be created automatically, e.g., `Merge pull request`.

#### Pulling Changes to Your Local Machine

After a pull request is merged on GitHub, you can synchronize the changes with your local repository using:
```bash
git pull origin main
```
This command fetches the latest changes from the `main` branch on the remote repository and integrates them into your local repository.
